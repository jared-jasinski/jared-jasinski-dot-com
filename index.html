		<h2>about me</h2>
			<p>
				Introduced to electric guitar at a young age, I have always been fascinated by how much the instrument’s sound could be modified by different amplifiers and pedals. Little did I know this would eventually lead me down the electrical engineering rabbithole.
				
				Now that I have a greater understanding of electrical engineering from personal projects and schooling, I want to use that knowledge to assist in increasing the worlds compute.</p>

		<p>In the world of super legitimate low liquidity crypto tokens, investing first is frequently more important than investing smart.
			Using telegram, this tool gave an edge by finding mentions of new ponzis popping up on the Ethereum network.

		<h3>nintendon't switch</h3>
		<img src="images/switch.jpg">
		<p>Frustrated with the availability of emulators on iOS, I set out to create a handheld capable of playing
			whatever games I wanted from the Atari era to the Nintendo DS. After modeling the body and buttons to 3D
			print, wiring all the inputs and programming the microcontroller, I thought to myself, “Wow this is a lot of
			work just to play some Super Mario Bros."</p>

		<h3>carmunnicator</h3>
		<img src="images/car.jpg">
		<p>Cars simply don’t have enough ways to communicate. Honks sound rude and turn signals are limited to left and
			right. With this design, show other drivers anything you want on a 16x16 LED grid! Someone let you merge?
			Show some love with a heart. Get cut off? The possibilities are endless.</p>

		<h3>fuzz tone guitar pedal</h3>
		<img src="images/pedal.jpg">
		<p>Inspired by some of the world's best, this pedal was created to mimic the sounds of Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray
			Vaughan and Eric Johnson. After plugging in, it's obvious why the pedal dominated the 60's and 70's. It
			sounds great and requires few electrical components — what else could you ask for?</p>
